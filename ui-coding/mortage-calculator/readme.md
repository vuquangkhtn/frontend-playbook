Build a simple mortgage calculator widget that takes in a loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and calculates the monthly mortgage payment, total payment amount, and total interest paid.

Requirements
The user should be able to enter:
Loan amount ($)
Annual interest rate (%). This is also known as the annual percentage rate (APR)
Loan term (in years)
Using the inputs, the calculator should compute the following and display the results to the user:
Monthly mortgage payment
Total payment amount
Total interest paid
If a non-numerical string is entered into any input field, the calculator should display an error message. Additionally, the calculator should handle any other invalid inputs that may arise.
Round the result amounts to 2 decimal places.
The last two requirements might not be given to you during interviews, you're expected to clarify.

The formula for calculating the monthly payment is:

M = P(i(1+i)n)/((1+i)n - 1)

M: Monthly mortgage payment
P: Loan amount
i: Monthly interest rate (APR / 12)
n: Total number of payments (loan term in years x 12)

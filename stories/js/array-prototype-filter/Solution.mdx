This question is pretty straightforward and just tests that you know how to access the array values within Array.prototype methods (using this).

Solution
Initialize a new array to store the filtered results. As we loop through the array (via this), call the callback on each array element with the following parameters: element, index, array, and this. This be done by either using Function.prototype.call or Function.prototype.apply.

If the callback evaluates to true, push the element into the results.


```ts
/**
 * @template T
 * @param { (value: T, index: number, array: Array<T>) => boolean } callbackFn
 * @param {any} [thisArg]
 * @return {Array<T>}
 */
Array.prototype.myFilter = function (callbackFn, thisArg) {
  const len = this.length;
  const results = [];

  for (let k = 0; k < len; k++) {
    const kValue = this[k];
    if (
      // Ignore index if value is not defined for index (e.g. in sparse arrays).
      Object.hasOwn(this, k) &&
      callbackFn.call(thisArg, kValue, k, this)
    ) {
      results.push(kValue);
    }
  }

  return results;
};
```

Edge cases
Passing the index and array to the filter callback.
Invoking the filter callback with the correct this if thisArg is specified.
Sparse arrays, e.g. [1, 2, , 4]. The empty values should be ignored while traversing the array.
Notes
Mutating the array in the filter callback is a bad idea and can cause unintended consequences. It is a positive signal to mention that mutation of the array within the callback is possible. The provided solution follows the TC39 specification for array mutation scenarios:

The range of elements processed by filter is set before the first callback is called.
Elements appended to the array after the call to filter begins will not be visited by the callback.
If existing elements of the array are changed, their value as passed to the callback will be the value at the time filter visits them.
Elements that are deleted after the call to filter begins and before being visited are not visited.
The thisArg doesn't do anything if the callback is defined as an arrow function as arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this.

One-liner solution
You can cheat the autograder by doing this:

```ts
Array.prototype.myFilter = Array.prototype.filter;
```

Spec solution
Here's a solution that is based off the Array.prototype.filter ECMAScript specification.

```ts
Array.prototype.myFilter = function (callbackFn, thisArg) {
  if (
    typeof callbackFn !== 'function' ||
    !callbackFn.call ||
    !callbackFn.apply
  ) {
    throw new TypeError(`${callbackFn} is not a function`);
  }

  const len = this.length;
  const A = [];
  let k = 0;
  let to = 0;

  while (k < len) {
    // Ignore index if value is not defined for index (e.g. in sparse arrays).
    const kPresent = Object.hasOwn(this, k);
    if (kPresent) {
      const kValue = this[k];
      const selected = Boolean(callbackFn.call(thisArg, kValue, k, this));
      if (selected === true) {
        A[to] = kValue;
        to += 1;
      }
    }
    k += 1;
  }

  return A;
};

```

## Key Takeaway
### With .call(thisArg, ...):

Explicitly sets the this context when calling the function
The first argument to .call() becomes this inside the function
Allows the callback to access a custom this value
### With callbackFn(...) directly:

In strict mode: this is undefined
In non-strict mode: this is the global object (window in browsers)
No way to pass a custom this value
### Arrow Functions Break This Pattern
Arrow functions do not have their own this—they inherit it from the enclosing scope. This means:
```ts
// Regular function - respects the thisArg
const isThisProductEven = function (element: number) {
  return (element * this) % 2 === 0;
};

[1, 2, 3, 4].myFilter(isThisProductEven, 10)  
// ✅ Works: this = 10 (set by .call())
// Returns [1, 2, 3, 4] because 1*10=10 (even), 2*10=20 (even), etc.

// Arrow function - ignores the thisArg
const isThisProductEvenArrowFn = (element: number) =>
  (element * this) % 2 === 0;

[1, 2, 3, 4].myFilter(isThisProductEvenArrowFn, 10)  
// ❌ Doesn't work: this = whatever the outer scope's this is
// The thisArg=10 is completely ignored
// Returns [] because this is undefined/global, not 10
```

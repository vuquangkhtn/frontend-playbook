# setCancellableTimeout

Implement a function `setCancellableTimeout()` that acts like the native `setTimeout()` but returns a cancel function instead of a timer ID. This provides a cleaner, more functional API for managing delayed operations.

The function should have the exact same signature as `setTimeout()`:

```ts
setCancellableTimeout(callback);
setCancellableTimeout(callback, delay);
setCancellableTimeout(callback, delay, param1);
setCancellableTimeout(callback, delay, param1, param2);
setCancellableTimeout(callback, delay, param1, param2, /* …, */ paramN);
```

## Examples

```ts
let i = 0;

// t = 0: Schedule timeout
const cancel = setCancellableTimeout(() => {
  i++;
}, 100);

// t = 50: Cancel before execution
cancel();

// t = 100: i is still 0 because timeout was cancelled
```

## Key Characteristics

- ✅ Returns a cancellation function instead of a timer ID
- ✅ Executes callback only once, after the specified delay
- ✅ Supports all `setTimeout()` parameters
- ✅ Passes additional arguments to the callback
- ✅ Can be cancelled at any time before execution

## Differences from setInterval

| Feature | setTimeout | setInterval |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Execution | Once, after delay | Repeatedly at interval |
| Returns | Timer ID | Timer ID |
| Typical Duration | Seconds to minutes | Long-running |
| Use Case | One-time delayed action | Repeated periodic action |
